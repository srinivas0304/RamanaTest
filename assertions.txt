By testing something we need validate.

Assertion is an expression which will verify the actual test outcome with the expected testoutcome.

Assertions are mandatory.

Assert is a static class, so we can call methods in it directly

assertEquals
assertNotEquals
assertTrue
assertFalse
assertNull
assertNotNull

Assert.assertEquals(actualTitle, expectedTitle);

Assertions are two types:

1) Hard Assertion                                     2) Soft Assertion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Hard Assertion: 

--> Hard assertion is an assertion which throws the exeception immediately upon failure of assertion.

--> After assertions method control will not move to the next line. 

--> What ever we use from Assert class by default all are the Hard Assert. Means Assert.assertEquals() after this line what ever the will be next line it will not execute.

--> If the assertEquals throws an exception at the same line and statements written after the assertions will not be executed.


2) Soft assertion:
