Set 
1) HashSet
2) LinkedHashSet
3) TreeSet

above 3 are the classes of Set

List------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Set

It maintains order					it does'n follow insertion order

We can store duplicates values				No

By using indexing we can remove or insert 		No(No index position)

HashSet:

--> HashSet is a Set interface implementation class

--> By using Set interface we cannot create Objects so, with the help of implementation class we can create objects.

--> We can store group of objects and single values

--> HashSet is a nonsynchronised, where it is not thread safe.

--> With the help of HashTable and creates Hashcode

--> When we perform search options we go for HashSet

--> Based on the HashTable the values will be printed 


HashSet							LinkedHashSet					TreeSet

--> It does't insertion order 					--> It follows insertion order				It will Sort and prints in ascending order
							--> HashTable+DoublyLinkedList															--> from doublylinkedlist we store the values in hashtable
							--> DLL used for insertion order
