HashMap is a class implements Map Interface

extends AbstractMap

it contains only unique elements

stores the values - key - value pair

it may have one null key and multiple null values

it maintains no order


HashMap is a part of java.util package.

HashMap extends an abstract class AbstractMap which also provides an incomplete implementation of Map interface.

It also implements Cloneable and Serializable interface. K and V in the above definition represent Key and Value respectively.

HashMap doesn’t allow duplicate keys but allows duplicate values. That means A single key can’t contain more than 1 value but more than 1 key can contain a single value.

HashMap allows null key also but only once and multiple null values.

This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, 
it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. It is roughly similar to HashTable but is unsynchronized.
