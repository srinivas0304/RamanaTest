Every method present in the StringBuffer is syncronised

The threads are required to execute one by one, it increases waiting time of thread and performance going down

Only one thread is allowed to operate on the StringBuffer object


for multi threaded environment we dont recommend StringBuffer

In order to overcome this problem we use StringBuilder from 1.5 version

Non synchronised version of StringBuffer is StringBuilder
