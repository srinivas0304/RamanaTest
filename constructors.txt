Constructors: Constructor is a special type of method in java, which gets executed each and every time, whenever the object is created.

purpose: The main purpose of constructor is to initialize class varibales

It is good practice to write constructors after the class.

Ex: public class Student
{
	public Student()
	{
	          Sopln("Defaulf constructor");
	}
}



this --> is a keyword which is used to refer current object which is under execution
--> used when we are initilize class variables.

--> Java convention says to use the constructor to initialise the non static properties during the object creattion itself.

--> Because, if we allow the user (user logic) to initialise the property after the object creation there is always the possibilities of forget to initialise the non static properties.

--> And the functions/methods do not works properly and developer do not get either compile time error nor runtime problem (exception).

--> By using the constructor if developer forgets to initialise the properties then the automatically developers get complie time error.
